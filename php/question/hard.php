<!-- Problem Statement: 1
You are tasked with building a grade management system for a class of students. The system should handle the following operations using functions:

Store Student Data:

Each student has a name (string), age (integer), and grades (array of integers).
Calculate the Average Grade:

The system should calculate the average grade of a student. The average should be a floating-point number (double).
Check if the Student Passed:

The system should check if the student has passed the class. A student passes if their average grade is 60 or more. This should return a boolean value (true or false).
Get the Highest Grade:

The system should find and return the highest grade in the student's array of grades.
Display Student Information:

Display the student's name, age, and whether they passed or not. -->


<!-- 
$name = "John Doe";
$age = 18;
$grades = [85, 90, 78, 92];

$average = calculateAverage($grades);
$highestGrade = getHighestGrade($grades);
$passed = hasPassed($average);

echo "Average Grade: " . $average . "<br>";
echo "Highest Grade: " . $highestGrade . "<br>";
echo "Has Passed: " . ($passed ? "Yes" : "No") . "<br>";
displayStudentInfo($name, $age, $passed);
